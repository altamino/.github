![Status badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-dead-red)

AltAmino is project that trying to replicate Amino API servers.

It will ALWAYS open source, every issue and pull request will be reviewed if main servers are up and status of project is active.

### Repos:
- [altamino/api](https://github.com/altamino/api) (api servers)
- [altamino/apps](https://github.com/altamino/apps) (apps to access AltAmino)
- [altamino/landing](https://github.com/altamino/landing) (landing page)

## Status details

We have no interest in continue project, plus Amino is dying as Team Amino doesn't really wanna work at this project. Absolute zero interest in community, 100% interest in money and ads.

I am as team leader shutting this project down. But you can fork it and do whatever you want.

Consider to look at Kyodo (if its still up). DO NOT look at Project Z / Clover space since its just straight dead crypto garbage can.

You can still look at projects that we are cooking.

Thx.
