![Status badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-paused-yellow)

AltAmino is project that trying to replicate Amino API servers.

It will ALWAYS open source, every issue and pull request will be reviewed if main servers are up and status of project is active.

### Repos:
- [altamino/api](https://github.com/altamino/api) (api servers)
- [altamino/apps](https://github.com/altamino/apps) (apps to access AltAmino)
- [altamino/landing](https://github.com/altamino/landing) (landing page)


## Status details

Project will be unpaused on December 1, 2024. We will rewrite entire codebase to Golang and will add communities (at least one to test all necessary methods).

Sadly, we can't in original Amino's app run voice chats since it uses Agora, and this thing is paid, and will cost us a ton of money. We will work later on own voice chats, but it's not important for us now.

Team lead also will try to figure out donations to help us running servers (at least own S3 storage). No promises btw.

Follow us and be ready for storm!
