## Status details

As Team Lead is dealing with the military recruitment center, the project is frozen as it is unknown if he will remain Team Lead or not.
In case of a known result, the project will continue to develop, but the Team Lead may be a different person for about a year and a half or two years.
Our team is trying to do its best to keep the development of the project going.

We also plan to make cryptocurrency donations so you can help pay for the servers. The project requires a server for API and Websocket (~4$), mail-server (~1$) and S3-storage*.

*S3-storage is currently used for free. When it will be possible to allocate 5$ for it steadily, we will move to our own.
